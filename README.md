# My elite date guessing game
In this game you try to guess the dates of historically important events, trying to get as low off as possible. The amount you can get off for any one question is 100. Much like in golf, the lowest score is the best.
## How to play
You play by inputing the best guess for the event that is shown to you. You will get points based on how far off you are, with a maximum of 100 points per question. Your goal is acheiving as small a score as possible.
